Lumyn 🧠✨ (read this if you dont have time)

Lumyn is a mental wellness application built using the MERN stack and powered by Gemini AI.
The goal is simple: help users understand their personality patterns and emotional roles, and offer practical therapy-style guidance for better mental health.

🧩 What Lumyn Does
Lumyn asks users 5 carefully designed questions that explore how they function emotionally and socially.
These questions focus on roles people often fall into, such as:
Caretaker for loved ones
Provider or problem-solver
Emotional supporter
Independent / self-reliant role
People-pleaser or protector
Based on the responses, Gemini AI analyzes patterns and identifies the user’s dominant personality role.

🧠 AI-Powered Personality Insight
After the questionnaire, Lumyn provides:
A clear personality breakdown
Strengths and blind spots of that role
Emotional habits and stress triggers
Behavioral patterns in relationships and life
No vague horoscope-style results — it’s practical and grounded.

🌱 Mental Wellness & Therapy Guidance
Lumyn doesn’t stop at analysis.
It also offers therapy-inspired suggestions, such as:

Coping strategies tailored to your role
Emotional boundary-setting advice
Daily mental wellness practices
Reflection prompts to improve self-awareness
Suggestions inspired by CBT and mindfulness techniques
This is supportive guidance, not a replacement for professional therapy.
